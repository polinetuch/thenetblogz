                I am a junior full-stack web developer based
                in Melbourne. 
                I enjoy problem solving and currently interested
                in learning more about React and making things
                pretty and easy to use. I am also adventurous
                with <span>üçúüçïüçôüçù</span>. This may sounds weird to some but
                I've eaten these guys before
                ü¶ó and tarantula.
