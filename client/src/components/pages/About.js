            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>my name is polinet. before getting to know
                me. i thought it'd be cool to write everything
                in lowercase. let's get to business. i am a
                junior full-stack web developer; graduated from
                monash university coding bootcamp. i have done an
                intensive 6 months of coding. i enjoy it more than
                i do. 
            </p>
            <p>
                i was a former teacher. i did enjoy but my passion
                for coding took control over me. i didn't regret any
                part of it. it's been an awesome journey.
            </p>
            <p>

                relearnt the skills i have so that i could extend on.
